- 👨‍🎓 I hold a degree in Computer Networks and I am close to completing my degree in Software Engineering, with over 6 years of experience in the field of Information Technology.

- 🏋️ I have had the opportunity and challenge of working in various areas, including Networks, Datacenter Infrastructure, Firewall, Operating Systems, and Monitoring. This diverse experience has provided me with a strong foundation in fundamental concepts necessary to tackle challenges in Cloud environments, such as AWS, GCP, OCI, and Azure, as well as the latest technologies like Kubernetes, Infrastructure as Code, GitOps, and Observability, which play a crucial role in the current era of Platform Engineering, where I currently work.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning __GitOps__, __Platform Engeering__ and __Enterprise Solutions__. I'm focusing on getting some certifications and improve my English.
 
- 💬 Ask me about __Cloud Computing__, __Kubernetes__, __DevOps__ and __SRE__.
